# Introduction

The ***eLLMental*** project was born out of the need for developers to have **a single toolset that combines flexibility,
efficiency, and productivity** while building AI-driven applications. As a team specializing in AI product development,
we've started to find recurrent challenges that motivated us to start building this project:

1. :hammer_and_wrench: **Lack of Robust Tools and Libraries:** As the field is relatively new, there's a shortage of high-quality production-ready 
tools that help developers to iterate quickly at a certain scale.
2. :brain: **MLOps management:** There are no "single click" MLOps solutions that let developers start working on their applications 
fast without investing a significant amount of time.
3. :lock: **Security**: Ensuring minimal security standards of the underlying infrastructure, including network security, 
firewall configurations, and container security, is a major challenge.
4. :key: **Privacy:** It's unclear how privacy is handled when using models through an API provided by a startup.
5. :jigsaw: **Dependency to the Python stack:** Most existing tools were designed by and for data scientists that use Python as 
their default go-to programming language, but most production apps, especially in the enterprise world, use JVM or .Net based stacks. This affects the language used, tooling and configuration management.

Overall, ***eLLMental*** is designed to help software engineers efficiently build AI-driven applications by
**removing all common headaches while integrating AI into your development environment.**
