However, not all databases are suitable for this task. The main problem is that the embeddings are high-dimensional vectors, which makes it difficult to store them in a database. It is also required that the database has a way to perform similarity searches on the embeddings.","sidebar":"docs"},"semantic_search/getting_started":{"id":"semantic_search/getting_started","title":"Getting Started","description":"In this section, you will look at different ways to set up, run and consume this service on your local machine.
